<!-- Lets go and look at the bootstrap website for reference of the syntax that we will need to create the columns... http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid    -->



    <div class="row">

<!-- I am going to use the medium size grid system.   So lets insert the 3 column medium grid -->

<!-- We will close the div  for this medium column grid, then we will repeat that with each of the columns that we have below.  The medium grid size is a great way to set things up, as the large is quite large and ofcourse the small is too small  -->
