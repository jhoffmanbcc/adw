 <!-- Since we are using cowboy slang, we will have a few apostrophes and we will use 1 ampersand for our text.  We we use these elements it is important to use the html character reference for those elements, unlike regular letters, we will need to treat these differently to maintain consistency accross all browsers.  Here is a link that shows us very common character references:  http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp -->

<!-- Using &rsquo; will produce a nice curly apostrophe. Typing ' will produce a prime symbol, which is technically the wrong character to use. Most people can't tell the difference, though, and it can be a pain to type a real apostrophe if your keyboard doesn't have an apostrophe key. Ofcourse this is nuance, but it may come into play when you use databases and move along the trail of webdesign  -->
