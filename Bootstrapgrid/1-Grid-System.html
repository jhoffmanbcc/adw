<!-- Lets look at the Bootstrap Grid System, in the same vein as our knowledge on 960.gs in previous chapters.  The Bootstrap Grid System is a responsive grid that scales to 12 columns.  Remember, Bootstrap begins from the vantage point of mobile design, and expands outwards to fullfill a larger viewport.  There are four grid sizes for Bootstrap... 

The Bootstrap Grid system has predefined classes for the different layout options that you would like to create.

here is the link to the Grid System:  http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid -->


<!-- If we look at the Grid Options, we will see that there are four different sizes to design our grid.  Those sizes are Extra Small for Mobile, Small Devices for Tablets, Medium Devices for Desktops, and Large Devices for Desktops.  The extra small devices will be horizontal at all times, while the other sizes have horizontal breakpoints where they will stack horizontally -->


<!-- Essentially if you have created a web page with the large screen that is greater than or equal to 1200, than when the browser window goes under that area, your columns will go underneath each other and stack instead of laying out accross the page -->

<!-- When we start playing with the grid systems more, we will begin to understand which path will work best for us -->
