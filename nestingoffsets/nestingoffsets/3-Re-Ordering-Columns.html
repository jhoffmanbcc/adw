<!-- Now lets look at Re-ordering our columns.  -->

<!-- You will notice that when we begin to move down to our mobile version, and all the items begin to get stacked on top of each other... that things can get funky... Well in this situation we may want to start to re-organize the priorities on our page -->

<!-- Previously, we discussed that we created an aside... and the aside is a bit of information that is not the largest priority of the site, rather the article is the most important part of the site.  -->

<!-- Well when the page collapses and things start to stack on top of each other, the Aside currently appears above the article... This is not that great, because we know that the article is more important than the aside, and we will want it to appear before the aside... So then now we will want to go ahead and learn how to re-arrange the ordering so when the site becomes mobile ready, the article stacks on top of the other area  -->
