<!-- Now lets start building our first html web page ... We will start our html page and link 
the needed CSS attributes-->



<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

		<meta charset="utf-8">

		<!--OK.. Now we will use a new piece of code that incorporates the "Viewport" and "MetaName" -->

		<meta name= "viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

		<!-- the purpose of this tag is to scale the screen properly for responsive design... likely it does not look too shocking, after looking at media queries and how we can use them to link in stylesheets.

		So what does it mean?  Setting a viewport tells the browser how content should fit on the device's screen and informs the browser that the site is optimized for mobile. It also tells the browser to set the viewport to the width of the device with an initial scale of 1. 

		If you would like more information on this... you can review this website that goes into further detail on the topic.   http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/mobifying/  -->

		<title>  Building a Bootstrap Site </title>

		<!-- It does not matter where we place our style sheet references, I am just doing it like this to break things up a little... Now lets add our style sheet links -->

		<link href= "css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

		<!-- The above style sheet links to the sheets that we have integrated for Bootstrap, and discussed previously -->

		<!-- Now we will reference to a new style sheet that will be a custom style sheet that we have not created yet -->

		<link href= "css/custom.css" rel="stylesheet">

		<!-- So at this point lets create a custom style sheet and place it in our css folder, for later usage  -->
