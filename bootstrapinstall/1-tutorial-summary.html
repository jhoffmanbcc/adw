Bootstrap is a responsive design framework, which will help with building static and dynamic applications.  As a framework, bootstrap can be integtrated with other web application tools such as php, providing robust potential.  The framework is designed with a Mobile First Approach, where we think of designing for Mobile and scale up to 
larger design styles... which is an inverse from what we were thinking of before. 

The Bootstrap framework was originally created by Twitter for building the Twitter GUI. Twitter released the framework to the public over github.  A project sharing network.  As the number one downloadable item on github for some time now, Bootstrap contintues to adapt, grow, and provide a strong presence in the responsive design community.

Another framework which is often mentioned as a competitor to Twitter Bootstrap is Foundation. Foundation is a nice option when deciding on building with responsive design, although we will be moving forward with Bootstrap because of the strong public support and large population for usage. 

People that use bootstrap are:  NASA, Medicare, and ofcourse Twitter :)

As with CSS3, bootstrap does not have support for IE7 or Firefox 3.6  ->


<!--    getbootstrap.com  

Is the location where you can download bootstrap and get all the information that you 
will need to work with bootstrap.  It will download as a zip file in your downloads folder unless you specify otherwise... 

In the past they would include all the documenation together, although now they just send us the heart of bootstrap.  

Therefore will begin by just downloading with the "Download Bootstrap" Button ... the description below is "Compiled and minified CSS, JavaScript, and fonts. No docs or original source files are included."

Then you will want to create a folder on your desktop and place the folders (CSS, Fonts, and js) in that folder on the desktop  -->


<!-- Now we will want to open sublime text to begin building our first html page with bootstrap.  We now know multiple locations in which we can build a website.  We can build it directly on the server with the code editor in the Cpanel, or we can build it with a text editor application on our local computer.  

There are advantages and disadvantages between these two ways of building websites.  The advantage of working on the server is, the site will update immediately and changes will be live after we save them.  The disadvantages are that we will need to upload our files to the server and that we need an internet connection at all time to work on our project.

In this instance we choose the route of using a text editor application.  We will use sublime text, but you can use any text editor that you are comfortable with.  You can also use the Cpanel's code editor if you desire.   -->

<!-- Now that we are using sublime text we will want to import the entire folder that we placed on our desktop into Sublime text, this will initiate our working environment.

To do that we will open sublime text, and go to the top tool bar... At the top tool bar we will select Project -- Add Folder to Project -- and then we will select the project folder that we have on the desktop.  

Now we will see our folders on the left hand side-->


<!-- In this situation we will mainly focus on two files in the CSS folder.  Those files are the bootstrap.css file and the bootsrap.min.css file.  

The bootstrap.css file will look very familiar to us, while the bootstrap.min.css file is essentially one line of code that goes on forever.  Min stands for minified, and the purpose of this code is to take out as many characters as possible (spaces are characters too) so that your site will run faster.  It is considered machine readable vs human readable

It is actually the same file as the regular css file.  We will reference the .min file in this example, but we can look through the css file to view if there are areas that we need to make changes. ->


<!-- Then we have wo other main CSS files, the bootstrap-theme.css file and the bootstrap-theme.min.css, once again, one of these files is minified while the other one is not, although in this case the theme file has an additional significance. 

The theme file will provide a flat design, which add additional styling for your bootstrap site. If you want to play with the flat design of the style sheet.   We will not be focusing on this in the immediate future.  -->

<!-- The last file is the bootstrap.css.map file... this file is used for debugging, in specific instance of the preprocessor, something we will not worry about at this time -->


<!--  In the fonts folder, 

http://marcoceppi.github.io/bootstrap-glyphicons/

there are five different fonts, which are all exactly the same but just created in different formats.  These are not your traditional fonts, they are icons that you can use for your design that are vector based, so that you can scale them at your whimsy -->

<!-- Lastly we have the javascript folder, there is the min and the regular js.  This is currently part of our current workflow for our design, although we will also add some more javascript files to help with the structuring of our site... don't worry, no previous javascript knowledge is necessary... ;) -->
