<!-- Lastly we will need to go get a version of javascript, called respond.js.   This is used to help integrate our webpage with older versions of Internet Explorer and its compatibilites. We will find this by going to the website, https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond ->

<!-- To setup the respond.js, after visiting the site, we will go to the "dtest" folder then we will click on the file respond.min.js.  After clicking on that file, we will need to copy all the content in the file by higlighting the content in the window pane.  -->

<!-- When you copy the information in the window we will take that information, and create a new file in Sublime Text in the javascript folder.  Paste the content in the new file and save it as respond.js -->

<!-- Now that we have made our respond.js file, we will see that it states we should add our link for this file earlier rather than later, so that if we are on an IE browser our site will catch it as soon as possible.  Therefore we will add our link to the respond.js file in our head right after our custom.css files -->

<!-- Awesome, we now have everything we need to create a bootstrap website!!  HOOORAY!! -->
