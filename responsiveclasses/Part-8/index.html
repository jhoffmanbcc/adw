<! If you want to bake in capabilities for earlier broswers .. 
you can always utilize conditional comments.. which are once
again logical operators that will test the browser that is using
the site to see if it is compatible or not ->

<!-- [if lt ie9]-->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="ie.css">
<!--[endif]-->

<! This esentially states... if the browser is less than (lt) ie9
than use the following stylesheet... and then the second part 
just ends the if ... letting your code continue ... kind of like
detour code -->
