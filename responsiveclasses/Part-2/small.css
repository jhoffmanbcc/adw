/* By adding the content that we had within the previous media query... we will
essentially receive the same effect */

.column {

		width: 100%;

/* so after trying the two different types of media queries... there are 
advantages and disadvantages to both of them...

An embedded media query ... does not inlcude an extra css file .. .therefore
your site will run a bit faster since it does not have to make an extra 
http request ... 

The embedded version also allows you to keep all the styles
in a singular location... for example.. you can list each media query under
each other... so that they are easy to visually understand what you created. 

Although if you have a lot of information on your page.. the embedded css
option may create too long of a page.. .and therefore it may be easier
to organize with multiple pages. */
