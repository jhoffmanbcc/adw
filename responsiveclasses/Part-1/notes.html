<! Now we will adjust the stylesheet... to be more dynamic.. and responsive, by adding a new media type... we will add the media type inbetween the link relative and the href.. ->

<! If we follow this link  http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_mediatypes.asp we can see thathere are quite a few of extra media types for accessibilty ... ->

<! media queries function as if/else statements, which are true or false statements, detecting what the screen size is that you are utlizing... the most common media-types are:  screen, print, handheld, or tv... so first we 
will decide where we are planning on creating this if/else relationships... for
our example, we will selectt screen 

our stylesheet call or link will begin looking like the following... 

<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and 


After we have decided on the media type we will add the term "and" and we will 
select the media feature that we want to use.  Possible media features are:
width, height, min-width, min-height, max-width, and max-height ...

for our first stylesheet reference we will select the media feature of min-width..

therefore our link will loook like the following:

<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)" href="small.css"

notice that we placed a bracket around the MEDIA FEATURE, and assigned a value to 
associate with that feature.  That value is considered a "break point" this is the
number where we want the site to change and to display new styles associated with 
the new size of the site.




for example when we add -- media="screen and (min-width: 0px)" ->

<!  the website will look and try to detect if the screen width is greater than 0px... in this case it will display the small.css page that we created ->

<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)" href="small.css">

<! then we will override that css style sheet at a higher width of 1000px->


 <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 600px)" href="medium.css">

 <! then we will override that css style sheet at a higher width of 1400px->


 <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 1000px)" href="large.css">
